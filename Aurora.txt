The University of Manitoba evaluates external courses for possible transfer credit on a course-by-course basis. Credit is determined based on review of detailed course outlines/syllabi by the applicable department or teaching unit, and is subject to final approval by the program of admission.

Where sufficient overlap in course content does not exist, courses may be assigned unspecified (general) credit (e.g. PSYC 1XXX TRANSFER 1000 LVL).


Courses transferred from external institutions (other than Department of English courses) do not satisfy the University of Manitoba's Written English Requirement, or Engineering Written Requirement list (WE), except by individual assessment. Further information regarding individual assessment of the Written English Requirement can be obtained by contacting the Dean's Office, Faculty of Arts, 3rd Floor Fletcher Argue. See Section 2.2 General Academic Regulations and Requirements in the Undergraduate Calendar.


For current University of Manitoba students seeking external course study on a Letter of Permission, grade indicators are:
LP: Course has been approved for external studies on a Letter of Permission.
LP PN: Course is pending a program decision. Approval has not been granted.
LP DN: Course has been denied for use towards your program of study.


The R (Repeat) column is used to indicate courses that have been assessed against the University of Manitoba's Course Repeat regulations. External transfer courses with subsequent repeats prior to Fall 2016 should have an indicator of E (exclude) on all but the most recent attempt. An active course registration effective Fall 2016, forward, will have an A (include in GPA) repeat indicator applied to all but the highest attempt. M (manual) or S (system) simply identifies how the repeat indicator was applied.
